## Hi, I'm Duncan Stangel! 👋

# 📓 🔍 🕵 

I'm a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame studying Global Affairs and Theology, with aspirations to incorporate data-driven research to a career in law of as a professor political science. Currently, I research democracy within the Kellog Institute of International Studies to understand the effects of party system institutionalization on democracy. I'm expanding my professional skills this semester by learning R as a part of my research. 

# R 🏈 🏃 📰 🌴 

In my spare time, I enjoy American football, running, working for my college newspaper (The Observer), and watching Survivor. I enjoy incorporating data analytics into my work, specifically for the Observer's growing Instragram following or quantifying strategic moves on tv.
